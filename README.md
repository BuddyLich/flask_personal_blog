###About the Blog
This blog is mainly based on Corey Schafer's flask tutorial on Youtube.
After finishing the tutorial, I made some custom changes to the web app, and remake the 
layout.

Since I don't know much about css, the current looking of the blog is kind of ... awful, 
but at least it works. I will change it after I study some front-end framework anyway.
 
Now the blog is deployed on http://www.buddylich.com, feel free to pay a visit.
