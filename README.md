# flask_personal_blog
A project for personal blog based on the previous flask blog project

Last time I did anything to the flask blog was couple months ago, so it seems better to redo everything
then make changes based on it. Frankly I've forgot most of the thing from the tutorial.

There will be something different from last time. This time there won't be a register/login page, and I will try to use
 markdown in the page.


# Todo list
1. Build the original flask blog base on Corey Schafer's tutorial chapter after chapter. Then deployer it on...idk,
maybe AWS? Deploying stuff on cloud server is also something I need to learn in future. Anyway there are 15 chapters all together.
I will do it a bit faster this time. Maybe finish this in 2 weeks.

2. Make changes based on my own requirement. Such as markdown, category part and hashtag. All together maybe one week?

3. Maybe the whole blog will have huge change after I learn some other tricks. Maybe someday I will replace the blog with
Django, or learning some front-end framework. Anyway that will happen after a long time.
